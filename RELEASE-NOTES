*************
version 0.5.1
*************

* fixed handling non-DataStream chunked responses (issue 1438)


***********
version 0.6
***********

* fixed exception description for non-deserializable responses from HTTP
  servers with error responses (issue 1033)


***********
version 0.5
***********

* YamlRpcHandler module updates: minor error logging updates, updated minimum
  qore version to 0.8.12 for get_ex_pos() and the module license value and
  also the UnitTest module
* added the following user modules implementing DataStream protocol support:
  - DataStreamUtil
  - DataStreamClient
  - DataStreamRequestHandler
* user modules moved to top-level qore module directory from version-specific
  module directory since they are valid for multiple versions of qore
* date/time values (yaml !!timestamp type) are now always returned in the
  current time zone locale so that time zone rules can be applied to
  deserialized dates, otherwise time zone information is always lost which can
  cause errors when performing date arithmetic on deserialized yaml dates
* deprecated camel-case function names in favor of names conforming to the
  standard naming convention for functions:
  - makeYAML() deprecated for make_yaml()
  - parseYAML() deprecated for parse_yaml()
  - getYAMLInfo() deprecated for get_yaml_info()


***********
version 0.4
***********

fixed a problem serializing and deserializing 0-length durations; they were serialized as "P" and then deserialized as a string; now they are serialized as "P0D" and deserialized correctly
enhanced the YamlRpcHandler module for more flexible logging


***********
version 0.3
***********

fixed a problem where an exception was not raised with invalid YAML input when parsing, instead NOTHING was returned
fixed a problem deserializing integers; the number was converted to a C++ double (floating-point type) first, causing precision to be lost with large numbers
added support for Qore's new number type when compiled with Qore 0.8.6+


***********
version 0.2
***********

fixed a problem with deserializing untagged and not double quoted integer and floating-point 0 and 0.0; they were incorrectly deserialized as strings
added additional information to the exception when a scalar value cannot be serialized (normally this happens when a string has an encoding error)
