***********
version 0.3
***********

fixed a problem where an exception was not raised with invalid YAML input when parsing, instead NOTHING was returned
fixed a problem deserializing integers; the number was converted to a C++ double (floating-point type) first, causing precision to be lost with large numbers


***********
version 0.2
***********

fixed a problem with deserializing untagged and not double quoted integer and floating-point 0 and 0.0; they were incorrectly deserialized as strings
added additional information to the exception when a scalar value cannot be serialized (normally this happens when a string has an encoding error)
