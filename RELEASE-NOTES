***********
version 0.4
***********

fixed a problem serializing and deserializing 0-length durations; they were serialized as "P" and then deserialized as a string; now they are serialized as "P0D" and deserialized correctly


***********
version 0.3
***********

fixed a problem where an exception was not raised with invalid YAML input when parsing, instead NOTHING was returned
fixed a problem deserializing integers; the number was converted to a C++ double (floating-point type) first, causing precision to be lost with large numbers
added support for Qore's new number type when compiled with Qore 0.8.6+


***********
version 0.2
***********

fixed a problem with deserializing untagged and not double quoted integer and floating-point 0 and 0.0; they were incorrectly deserialized as strings
added additional information to the exception when a scalar value cannot be serialized (normally this happens when a string has an encoding error)


*************
version 0.0.1
*************

Initial release of the YAML module
