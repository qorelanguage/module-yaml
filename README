Qore YAML module (yaml)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore yaml module provides simple de/serialization between Qore data and YAML strings.
For more information about YAML, see:
    	http://www.yaml.org

Basically this module provides a simple Qore-language API to libyaml
	http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML

Conversions are supported with all Qore data types (except objects and NULL) with no information loss.
Qore objects are currently not serialized, and NULL is serialized as YAML 'null'; deserialized as Qore NOTHING.

see README and docs for more information


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.0+ and libyaml 0.1.3+ to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libyaml cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-libyaml=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
