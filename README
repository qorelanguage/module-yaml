Qore YAML module (yaml)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Qore yaml module provides simple de/serialization between Qore data and YAML strings.
For more information about YAML, see:
    	http://www.yaml.org

Basically this module provides a simple Qore-language API to libyaml
	http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML

Conversions are supported with all Qore data types (except objects and NULL) with no information loss.
Qore objects are currently not serialized, and NULL is serialized as YAML 'null'; deserialized as Qore NOTHING.

see README and docs for more information


LICENSE
-------
The source code is released under the LGPL 2.1 and MIT licenses; either license
may be used at the user's discretion.  Note that both licenses are treated
equally by the Qore library in the sense that both licenses allow the module
to be loaded without restrictions by the Qore library (even when the Qore
library is initialized in GPL mode).
See COPYING.MIT and COPYING.LGPL for details on the open-source licenses.


BUILDING
--------
Requires qore 0.8.5+ and libyaml 0.1.3+ to build and run

to configure the build, execute
   	configure --disable-debug

if the qore library cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-qore=<dir>

if libyaml cannot be found, then you can use:
   	configure --disable-debug --with-libyaml=<dir>

The qore binary also needs to be in the path so configure can determine the module directory

Then execute

make && make install

(or 'make && sudo make install' as needed)
